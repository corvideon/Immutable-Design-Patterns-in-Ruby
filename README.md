## How to develop immutable objects in Ruby

Functional Programming has seen a resurgence in interest in the last few years and is often mentioned in opposition to Object-Orientated Programming.

This code is from a paper that examines three ways in which Immutability, a common Functional Programming technique, can be used to develop immutable objects in Ruby.
